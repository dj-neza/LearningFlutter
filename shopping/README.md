# ShoppingApp

A simple app to help me learn Flutter through practical examples. The app lets you browse and filter products and mark them as favourites. You can view the details of the product and add it to a shopping cart or even "place" an order. You can view your orders and manage (edit or remove) the products you added or add more products.
